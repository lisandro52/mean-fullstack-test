# mean-fullstack-test

Created with the [angular-fullstack generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack).

After testing the other known MEAN generators ([mean.io](http://mean.io) and [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org)), I found that their server-side code returned HTML templates to the view instead of JSON data, which is a more generic approach to build an API that could be reused by third-party applications.
